Just a small little personal project for tracking ones hormone levels and displaying that data on a graph (but mostly for the practice). VERY MUCH A WIP.

Currently enables:
adding and removing of test results data, saves as csv files.
viewing of test data either within a specified date range, or since the first entry.
viewing the results of these plotted on a graph.
adding and removing of notes that will also show on the plotted graph, saves as csv file.
setting of upper and lower limits for both E and T that will show as a shaded area on the graph, saves as a json file.

only runs in the terminal for now, but other than the odd visual weirdness here and there, functions as intended.

future plans mostly revolve around adding some kind of UI to make it less viscerally unpleasant to interact with.

Fun fact: I /think? I managed to get the colours to match those of the trans flag. :3
